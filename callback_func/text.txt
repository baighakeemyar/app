synchronous function: It is a function where nested functions are executed in a series. For example we have 3 function nested and once we
execute them, they will start in series one after another. No matter if the functionis ready or not it will wait for the response then it will
move to the other function.
asynchronous function: It is a parallel execution of functions. No matter if a function is ready to be executed or not it will call a function
which is ready, it will not wait for the first function to respond.

A callback is a function called when the task finishes, and a callback function allows other code to run in the meantime. 
Using the Callback concept, Node.js can process many requests without waiting for any function to return the result, 
making Node.js highly scalable.
